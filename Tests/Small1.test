It’s funny, Vasher thought, how many things begin with my getting thrown
into prison.
The guards laughed to one another, slamming the cell door shut with a
clang. Vasher stood and dusted himself off, rolling his shoulder and wincing.
While the bottom half of his cell door was solid wood, the top half was
barred, and he could see the three guards open his large duffel and riffle
through his possessions.
One of them noticed him watching. The guard was an oversized beast
of a man with a shaved head and a dirty uniform that barely retained the
bright yellow and blue coloring of the T’Telir city guard.
Bright colors, Vasher thought. I’ll have to get used to those again. In any
other nation, the vibrant blues and yellows would have been ridiculous on
soldiers. This, however, was Hallandren: land of Returned gods, Lifeless
servants, BioChromatic research, and—of course—color.
The large guard sauntered up to the cell door, leaving his friends to
amuse themselves with Vasher’s belongings.
