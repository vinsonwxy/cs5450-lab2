It flowed out of him, puffing into the air, translucent yet radiant, like the
color of oil on water in the sun. Vasher felt it leave: BioChromatic Breath,
scholars called it. Most people just called it Breath. Each person had one. Or,
at least, that was how it usually went. One person, one Breath.
Vasher had around fifty Breaths, just enough to reach the First Heightening.
Having so few made him feel poor compared with what he’d once
held, but many would consider fifty Breaths to be a great trea sure. Unfortunately,
even Awakening a small figure made from organic material—using a
piece of his own body as a focus—drained away some half of his Breaths.
The little straw figure jerked, sucking in the Breath. In Vasher’s hand, half
of the brilliant red scarf faded to grey. Vasher leaned down—imagining what
he wanted the figure to do—and completed the final step of the pro cess as he
gave the Command.
